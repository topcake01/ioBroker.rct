## Project NO LONGER MAINTAINED

After I switched to Home Assistant, I do no longer maintain this adapter.
If you are interested to take it over, please let me know.

## RCT adapter for ioBroker

Please note that this is a private project and that I (Markus Lauff) am not related to RCT in any way.

Show values of a RCT Power photovoltaics power converter

## REMARKS

### Initial productive release

This is an initial productive release after the previous version has proven stable and fulfilling the minimal viable scope.

Configuration is still limited and rather technical. Using the "RCT ELemente" it can be selected which data shall be read from the power converter. Default is "battery.bat_status,battery.soc,battery.soc_target,battery.soc_target_high,battery.soc_target_low,dc_conv.dc_conv_struct[0].enabled,dc_conv.dc_conv_struct[0].p_dc_lp,dc_conv.dc_conv_struct[1].enabled,dc_conv.dc_conv_struct[1].p_dc_lp,fault[0].flt,fault[1].flt,fault[2].flt,fault[3].flt,g_sync.p_ac_grid_sum_lp,g_sync.p_ac_load_sum_lp,g_sync.p_ac_sum_lp,g_sync.p_acc_lp,g_sync.u_sg_avg[0],g_sync.u_sg_avg[1],io_board.s0_external_power,power_mng.battery_type,power_mng.is_grid,power_mng.is_heiphoss,power_mng.state,power_mng.use_grid_power_enable,power_mng.u_acc_mix_lp,prim_sm.island_flag,prim_sm.state". Other elements can be found in the code (file "rct/rc_core.js"). But this is not self descriptive at all (even not really tested).

## Known Issues

### Wrong Channels / States

A new version might not be able to create the right ioBroker channels / states. In most cases this can be recognized by the node "battery" showing up as a single element instead of a folder.

If this happens, stop the adapter and manually delete the node "rct.0".
